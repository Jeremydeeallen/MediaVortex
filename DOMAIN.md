# MediaVortex Domain Decisions

Source of truth for domain-level "what does the system do and why" decisions.
Every entry answers ONE domain question with ONE committed decision.

Rules:
- Append-only. Old decisions get a `Superseded by <date>` line, never edit.
- No implementation details. Metric choices belong here; SQL columns and Python classes do not.
- Any code, rule, or table that answers the same question differently = refactor. This doc is the ratchet.
- Cross-check every new directive against this doc BEFORE opening.

## 2026-07-23 -- Pipeline operators

Question: What operations does MediaVortex perform on a media file?

Answer: Four operators. Nothing else.

- **Skip** -- leave the file alone.
- **Remux** -- copy video stream, re-encode audio, change container.
- **AudioFix** -- copy video stream, re-encode audio, preserve container.
- **Transcode** -- re-encode video + audio + container.

Every file passes through a classifier that returns exactly one operator. The classifier is a decision function with five branches:

```
IF audio-only container            -> out of scope
IF source is efficiently transcoded -> Skip / Remux / AudioFix depending on other compliance
IF video codec not in allowlist    -> Transcode
IF container not in allowlist      -> Remux
IF audio needs normalization       -> AudioFix
ELSE                                -> Skip
```

Consequence: any proposed feature that doesn't map to one of the four operators or the five-branch decision = refuse. Non-destructive archive of source (`MediaFilesArchive`) always. Jellyfin notify on any change to a served file.

## 2026-07-23 -- Definition of "efficiently transcoded"

Question: When is a file "efficiently transcoded" so we should not re-encode?

Answer: **SourceKbps <= profile target kbps at the file's resolution.**

The comparison uses the assigned profile's `TargetKbps` for the file's resolution (from `ProfileThresholds`). If the source is already at or below that target, re-encoding cannot meaningfully reduce size at the operator's chosen quality tier.

Consequences:
- Efficient files are STILL eligible for Remux (if container is not compliant) and AudioFix (if audio needs normalization). Only the Transcode operator is suppressed.
- Files without an assigned profile cannot be evaluated for efficiency and land in the `Unclassified` bucket by default.
- Files with an assigned profile whose SourceKbps exceeds the target enter the Transcode operator via the standard compliance path.
- This decision RETIRES the codec-blind `bpp` gate and the total-bitrate `SizeMB/DurationMinutes` proxy. Both were removed in favor of the direct SourceKbps-vs-TargetKbps comparison.
