### [FIXED] QueryDatabase.py sql command silently rolls back writes
**Date:** 2026-05-05 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-05
**Fix:** Added `--commit` flag. Default unchanged (rollback for safety).

### [FIXED] Yadif deinterlacing applied to progressive files
**Date:** 2026-05-05 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-05
**Fix:** Set YadifMode=NULL, YadifParity=NULL on all profiles. CommandBuilder skips yadif when NULL.

### [FIXED] StuckJobDetector breaks distributed transcoding
**Date:** 2026-05-05 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-05
**Fix:** All destructive operations scoped by WorkerName/ClaimedBy. GetActiveJobsByService includes WorkerName. SignalHandler, CrashRecoveryService, QueueManagementService all filter by worker.

### [FIXED] LocalStaging mode crashes workers without StagingDirectory configured
**Date:** 2026-05-07 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-07
**Fix:** All three job types validate `self.OutputDirectory` before entering LocalStaging mode. NULL falls back to InPlace.

### [FIXED] Post-transcode pipeline does not complete (VMAF + file replacement not firing)
**Date:** 2026-05-07 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-07
**Fix:** Removed dead ShouldTestFile(). ProcessTranscodedFile() reads QualityTestRequired from TranscodeAttempt. FileReplacementBusinessService accepts PathTranslation, translates canonical paths before filesystem ops.

### [FIXED] Thread-limiting changes degraded worker transcode performance
**Date:** 2026-05-07 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-07
**Fix:** Reverted `lp=N`, `MEDIAVORTEX_MAX_CPU_THREADS`, Docker `cpus` limit. SVT-AV1 `lp` does not reduce OS thread count; Docker CFS throttling is counterproductive with many idle threads.
**Remaining:** 4 workers at 480p preset 6 still only use ~10% of a 64-CPU system (480p frame size limits SVT-AV1 parallelism -- separate investigation).

### [FIXED] FFmpegService.py cpu_affinity overrides Docker cpuset pinning
**Date:** 2026-05-07 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-07
**Fix:** FFmpegService.py and VideoTranscodingService.py skip affinity calls when `/.dockerenv` exists. Docker cpuset is the sole CPU isolation mechanism in containers.

### [FIXED] Services resolve tool paths from SystemSettings instead of per-worker config
**Date:** 2026-05-08 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-08
**Fix:** WorkerContext singleton. FFmpegService resolves: explicit arg > WorkerContext > cached > SystemSettings. FileReplacementBusinessService auto-reads PathTranslation from WorkerContext.

### [FIXED] Concurrent job progress invisible in UI
**Date:** 2026-05-08 | **Fixed:** 2026-05-08
**Fix:** Removed `INNER JOIN TranscodeQueue` from progress queries. Progress now uses `TranscodeProgress + TranscodeAttempts WHERE Success IS NULL`.
**Note:** Queue rows for concurrent jobs still disappear (cause unknown). Audit trigger `trg_transcodequeue_delete` is in place.
